Library file for image building functions
Assume that the incoming filenames are "correct" in that
they have the entire desired path.

NOTE: for these, for now you can assume the images are to
be 512x512 and can build your formulae with that in mind.

on a few of these, there are image size parameters given
(which for now will be 512x512) and so you can try generating
images whose size is not predetermined/hardcoded.
